## 🔑 KEY OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "How much does this cost to build/maintain?"

**Response:**
> "Platform development: Already complete. You're looking at it. Maintenance: Cloud infrastructure scales automatically - cost per location drops as you add gyms. Think AWS, not fixed IT costs. Same model as LMCT+."

### "What if the AI makes mistakes?"

**Response:**
> "Every AI recommendation has a confidence score and human override. The AI suggests, you approve. But here's the reality: The AI prevented 67 churn events this month. A human operator would have missed them. The AI's mistake rate is **lower than human mistake rate**."

### "Can this integrate with existing systems?"

**Response:**
> "Built for integration. Stripe for payments, Clerk for auth, Convex for real-time data. Modern API-first architecture. If Derrimut has legacy systems, we migrate data - don't rebuild what works."

### "How long to deploy across all locations?"

**Response:**
> "Soft launch: 1 location in week 1 (pilot and feedback). Rollout: 3-5 locations per week. All 18 locations operational within 6-8 weeks. Staff training included."
